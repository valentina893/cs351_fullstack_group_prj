* Team members (Dale, Nathan, and Lebron) agreed that it was a good idea.
* Later discovered that *rating apps are not allowed* for the group project.
* Team decided to brainstorm *new project ideas* following this discovery.

**Topic: Framework Decision**

* Valentina suggested *Flask* since it’s easier.
* Nathan agreed, and the group reached consensus to use *Flask*.

**Topic: Milestone 2 Progress**
