**Meeting Notes – Project Update and Development Planning**

**Topic: Project Approval Process**

* Valentina sent an email to the TA requesting project approval (“green light”).
* The TA responded, and Valentina planned to draft a full reply later that day.
* The group discussed clarifying the *project track* and identifying the *target subgroup* of UIC students.
* Dale suggested targeting the *general UIC community* since multiple APIs could support that.
* Valentina emphasized that focusing on securing project approval was more important at this stage than API details.
* The updated project explanation was resent to the TA, with all team members copied on the email.
* The TA *officially approved (“green lit”) the project idea* shortly after.

**Topic: Milestone and Workflow Planning**

* Dale reminded the team that the next milestone was due soon and encouraged everyone to start working.
* He began creating the *wireframe* and proposed that each member work on a *separate Git branch* to demonstrate individual contributions.
* Valentina suggested beginning the *Figma wireframe*, *frontend*, and *backend* development once the idea was approved.

**Topic: Data Structure and Technical Design Discussion**

* Dale proposed using a *priority queue* for handling recommendations.
* Valentina clarified that recommendations would already be managed by the *search API* (e.g., DuckDuckGo API), making a priority queue redundant.
* She suggested possibly using a *trie* for storing user “interests,” but reconsidered and said she would think about better alternatives.
* Dale suggested that a trie could still be used for search functionality, and the priority queue might rank activities returned by the API.
* Valentina noted that the API’s built-in ranking would already handle ordering of results.

**Topic: Documentation and Backend Development**

* Valentina created an *illustration* showing how the program works.
* She planned to upload it to a *docs folder* in the GitHub repository and share it with the group.
* Valentina indicated she would begin *writing the backend code* next.

**Next Steps**

* Review and finalize the project wireframe.
* Begin building out the frontend and backend.
* Each member should use their own branch to contribute code.
* Review and refine data structure choices as development progresses.
* Continue documenting project progress in the repository.
